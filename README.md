# Udacity-DataAnalystNanodegree
This is the repo of the assignments, course content and projects of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. 

**Project 1:**

This is a simple file as I didnot use python to complete this course. I used MS-Excel to get this done.

**Project 2:**

The data source for this project is quite big. Hence I was not able to upload it here. Kindly use the source provided in the course.

**Project 3:**

Did some hypothesis testing, A/B Testing with the given data sets. 

A/B testing was performed on the given data sets just like how it would be done in an organisation.
Developed linear and logistic regression models to derive the p-value and came up with some conclusions that can be used to decide some business decisions.
